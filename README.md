# data-forge

---------

C# data transformation and analysis toolkit inspired by Pandas and LINQ.

Designed to work under .Net 3.5 so that it can be used with the [Unity game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)).

----------

Apologies to anyone who wants to use this, it isn't going anywhere quickly.

The [JavaScript version](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-js) has taken all my time so far. It is quite advanced but the C# version is barely stared.

If anyone wants to work on the C# version please let me know.

----------

This project is a work in progress, please don't use unless you want to be an early adopter. Please expect API changes. Please contribute and help guide the direction of *data-forge*.

## Project Aims

The aims of this project:

- To combine the best aspects of [Pandas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)) and [LINQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query) and make them available in JavaScript and C#.
- To be able to load data, transform and save data.
- To be able to prepare data for visualization. 
- Be able to load massive data files.

## Driving Principles 

The principles that drive decision making and tradeoffs:

- Simple, easy to learn, easy to use.
- Minimize the magic, everything should be understandable, the API should be orthogonal.
- High performance.
- Be able to use the same (or very similar) API in both Javascript and C#.
- The code you build during interactive data exploration should be transplantable to an app or microservice.

## Implementation

General implementation goals:

- Immutable, every operation generates a new immutable data set.
- Lazy evaluation, to make the performance of immutability acceptable.
- Extensible via plugins for data sources and formats.
